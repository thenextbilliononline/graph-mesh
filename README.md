#### Graph-Mesh

Graph theory workbooks and theory for mesh networks. 


'Introduction' is a good place to start as it introduces the basic concepts of graph theory in an interactive python notebook.  

'Colors' discusses the four-color theorem and its relation to spectrum management in mesh networks.  

'TDMA' examines the different possible TDMA techniques suitable for mesh networks.

'Possibility' is a notebook that originated as a document from @nicopace.  

'Future Work' describes work on other spectrum management techniques like channel management, quality-of-service, and community-controlled access.
